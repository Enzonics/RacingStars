Hi! You found my aptitude test for a new job. It a small birthday calculator, which calculates the amount of days until your next birthday!

If you'd like to play with the code, and run it by all means use 'npm start', as this project is made with React.

If you'd like to build the project as it is, run 'npm run build'

This project was made with React (create-react-app), dateJS, and tailwindCSS.
By Enzonics, conventially known as Oli.
